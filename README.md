### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Abrar Hayat from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I work as a Software Developer at <a href="https://le.unimelb.edu.au/" target="_blank">Learning Environments</a> at the University of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. I got into the software industry after I graduated from Electrical Engineering at the end of 2016 and since then my interests have settled here. I also completed a Master of IT in Artificial Intelligence in 2024. I mainly work on Web Applications but it often reaches Deep Learning, Mobile App Development and Game Development. In my free time, I like to take photos or sing and play my guitar. Learning gives me a different level of satisfaction, so learning new things is never going to stop for me.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently developing high-performance Full Stack Web Applications.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the latest web technologies and deep learning models
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting takes on new and innovative tech applied to our everyday lives
